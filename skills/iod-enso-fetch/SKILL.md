description: "Download Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) Indian Ocean Dipole and ENSO products: the current IOD, Niño3.4, Relative Niño3.4, or SOI monitoring graph and its index values, or an ACCESS-S IOD / Niño3.4 outlook plume and its monthly ensemble-mean and category-probability table. Also downloads NOAA CPC's relative ENSO indices: RONI (3-month seasons from 1950), monthly relative Niño3.4 (from 1949-12), and weekly relative Niño3.4 (from 1981). Writes a PNG figure or a time-series Zarr. Use when a task needs BoM's official IOD or ENSO index values, monitoring graph, or ACCESS-S forecast, or a long ENSO / RONI record at seasonal, monthly or weekly steps, e.g. for correlations. Use it instead of computing an index from SST fields, which is slow."

# iod-enso-fetch

Downloads a BoM IOD or ENSO graph as a PNG, or the index values behind it as a Zarr. Also downloads NOAA CPC's long relative ENSO records as Zarrs, each in about a second.

## Which index

| `--index` | Agency | Step | Record | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `roni` | NOAA CPC | 3-month running mean | 1950 on | NOAA's official ENSO index: classifying El Niño / La Niña seasons, analog years, and seasonal correlations. |
| `cpc-relative-nino3.4-monthly` | NOAA CPC | month | 1949-12 on | Monthly correlations or regressions over the longest record; the unsmoothed series RONI averages. |
| `cpc-relative-nino3.4-weekly` | NOAA CPC | week | 1981-09 on | Sub-monthly timing: onset, peak and decay, or lagged correlations with weekly rainfall. |
| `enso`, `relative-nino3.4` | BoM | week | 2008-07 on | BoM's ENSO index: its current value and graph, matching BoM's ENSO updates. |
| `nino3.4` | BoM | week | 2008-07 on | Traditional Niño3.4, only to match older work that used it. |
| `iod` | BoM | week | 2008-07 on | Indian Ocean Dipole Mode Index. |
| `soi` | BoM | 30-day window, daily | last ~3 years | Southern Oscillation Index, the atmospheric side of ENSO. |

Before fetching an ENSO index:
1. Ask the user which agency's index they prefer, NOAA CPC or BoM, unless they already said. Agencies define and threshold ENSO differently, and users often follow the one their met service uses.
2. Pick the time step that the analysis needs, not the finest one available: seasonal rainfall, El Niño / La Niña classification or analog years → `roni`; monthly anomalies → `cpc-relative-nino3.4-monthly`; weekly or dekadal rainfall, onset or lagged timing → `cpc-relative-nino3.4-weekly`. Match the step of the series it is compared with, and use the published series at that step rather than aggregating a finer one.
3. Do not compute Niño3.4 or another ENSO index from SST fields (OISST, ERA5, CMIP6 or forecast grids). That fetches and averages years of gridded SST, takes many minutes, and gives values that differ from the published index. It is an absolute last resort, only when no index here covers the period, step or model the task needs (such as another forecast model's own Niño3.4); tell the user before doing it.

The relative indices subtract the tropical-mean SST anomaly from Niño3.4, so a warming ocean does not read as El Niño; prefer them to `nino3.4` for anything spanning decades. CPC's monthly series and RONI come from ERSSTv5 and its weekly series from OISST, so their values differ slightly. No daily ENSO index or weekly RONI is published.

## Usage

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --index INDEX [--product observation|forecast] [--format figure|data] [--date YYYY-MM-DD] -o OUT.png|OUT.zarr
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --index INDEX --product forecast --probe-latest
```

### Arguments
- `--index` — `iod` (Dipole Mode Index), `enso` (same as `relative-nino3.4`), `relative-nino3.4`, `nino3.4` (traditional), `soi` (30-day SOI, observation only), `roni` (NOAA CPC Relative Oceanic Niño Index), `cpc-relative-nino3.4-monthly`, or `cpc-relative-nino3.4-weekly` (NOAA CPC relative Niño3.4). The three CPC indices are observation Zarrs only. Required.
- `--product` — `observation` (the current monitoring series) or `forecast` (an ACCESS-S outlook issue). Default: `observation`.
- `--format` — `figure` (PNG) or `data` (Zarr). Default: `data` when `-o` ends in `.zarr`, otherwise `figure`. A mismatched suffix (`data` with `.png`, `figure` with `.zarr`) exits 2.
- `--date` — forecast issue date; uses the latest issue on or before it (stderr notes the snap). Default: latest issue. Forecast only.
- `--probe-latest` — print a date and exit, no `-o`; takes no value. Forecast: the latest ACCESS-S issue. Observation: the graph's `Last-Modified` day (the text file's with `--format data`), or `none`.
- `--output`, `-o` — PNG or Zarr path.

### Output
- Figure: the BoM PNG with `weather_skills_history` in its metadata. Forecast figures are the plume of 99 members (grey), ensemble mean (green), and observations (black).
- Observation data: `(time)` with one variable.

  | `--index` | Variable | Units | `time` is | Interval |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `iod` | `iod_mode_index` | `degree_Celsius` | week-ending date | `time_bounds` (Monday to Sunday) |
  | `enso`, `relative-nino3.4` | `relative_nino34` | `degree_Celsius` | week-ending date | `time_bounds` (Monday to Sunday) |
  | `nino3.4` | `nino34` | `degree_Celsius` | week-ending date | `time_bounds` (Monday to Sunday) |
  | `soi` | `soi` | `1` | 30-day window end date | `data_interval` `1 day` |
  | `roni` | `roni` | `degree_Celsius` | season's middle month (DJF 1950 → 1950-01-01) | `time_bounds` (3 months, overlapping) |
  | `cpc-relative-nino3.4-monthly` | `relative_nino34` | `degree_Celsius` | first of the month | `time_bounds` (1 month) |
  | `cpc-relative-nino3.4-weekly` | `relative_nino34` | `degree_Celsius` | week's centre date (Wednesday) | `data_interval` `7 day` |
- Forecast data: `(time)` at month starts with `time_bounds`, scalar `init_time` (issue date), the index variable as the ensemble mean, and `prob_below` / `prob_neutral` / `prob_above` in `percent` of members beyond the event threshold (IOD ±0.4 °C, Niño ±0.8 °C).

### Notes
- Observations are current only: BoM and CPC overwrite the same files, so `--date` with `--product observation` exits 2. The full history is in each file.
- ACCESS-S issues start 2018-08-11. Relative Niño3.4 forecasts start with the 2025-07-01 issue; `enso` uses traditional Niño3.4 before that and `relative-nino3.4` exits 2.
- The 99 plume members exist only in the PNG; the Zarr holds the ensemble mean and category percentages.
- The current month's mean can be NaN in the forecast table.
- A CPC index (`roni`, `cpc-relative-nino3.4-monthly`, `cpc-relative-nino3.4-weekly`) with `--product forecast`, `--format figure`, or a non-`.zarr` `-o` exits 2.
- Neighbouring RONI values share two months, so they are strongly autocorrelated; account for that when testing a correlation's significance.

### Example
```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --index iod --product forecast --format data -o iod_fc.zarr
```
Writes the latest ACCESS-S monthly IOD ensemble mean and below / neutral / above percentages.

# CPC weekly relative Niño3.4, Sept 1981 to the latest week
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --index cpc-relative-nino3.4-weekly -o rnino34_weekly.zarr
# IOD plume from a past issue
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch.py --index iod --product forecast --date 2024-06-08 -o iod_20240608.png
```

Monthly and seasonal means from the BoM weekly values: `aggregate-temporal --period monthly` weights each week by its days in the month (a week split by a month edge counts in both) and stamps `aggregation_coverage`; then `label-group --time year --time DJF,MAM,JJA,SON` and `summarize-dim --by year --by month_group --method mean` give one value per season, NaN for a season the record does not fully cover (the current month is partial).
